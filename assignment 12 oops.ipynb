    "# ANSWER 1:-\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a programming \n",
    "paradigm that allows for better organization modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER 2:-\n",
    "In Python, an object is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP). An object is an instance of a class, \n",
    "which serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. \n",
    "It encapsulates both data (attributes) and the operations (methods or functions) that can be performed on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER 3:-\n",
    "In Python, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure, behavior, and attributes of objects. \n",
    "It is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP).\n",
    " A class provides a way to create objects, also known as instances, which are specific instances of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER 4:-\n",
    "Attributes:\n",
    "Attributes are the variables or data members of a class that hold data or state specific to each object created from the class.\n",
    "They represent the characteristics or properties of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods:\n",
    "Methods are functions defined within a class that define the behavior or actions that objects created from the class can perform.\n",
    "Methods operate on the attributes of an object and can modify the object's state or perform computations using the object's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER 5:-\n",
    "class variables and instance variables are two types of variables that are used within a class. Here are the differences between them:\n",
    "Class Variables: Class variables are defined within the class but outside of any instance methods. They are shared by all instances (objects) of the class and can be accessed using either the class name or an instance of the class.\n",
    "Instance Variables: Instance variables are specific to each instance (object) of the class. They are defined within the instance methods or the class's constructor (__init__() method) and hold unique values for each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER 6:-\n",
    "In Python, the self parameter in class methods serves as a reference to the instance of the class. \n",
    "It is a convention to name the first parameter of an instance method as self, although you can use any valid variable name in its place. \n",
    "The purpose of the self parameter is to enable access to the attributes and methods of the instance within the method.\n",
